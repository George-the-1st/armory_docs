Some Armory's Frequently Asked Question

## What version is Armory Engine at? When will Armory reach 1.0?

Currently at time of writing this Armory is at 0.6 Stable. It is not sure when Armory will reach 1.0, but give or take 1-2 years ;)

__

## What renderer do Armory uses? Cycles or EEVEE?

Armory uses it own renderer, ie., it neither uses Cycles or EEVEE So, it doesn't matter which renderer you use since Aromry compiles to it own renderer.

__

## What technology is behind Armory?

Armory boast usage of Blender and Ultimate Cross-platform portability of Haxe Kha, You can learn more about its [Architecture](dev/architecture.md).

__

## Is Armory “Production Ready”?

Well, it depends upon your defination.

Do you mean ready to produce a game - any game - and publish it? Well, it’s definitely ready to make a game like Flappy Bird, sure. You’re not going to produce the next instalment of Crysis on it just yet though.

Armory has some very strong features underneath the hood, which long term will be a huge benefit (such as massively cross platform support via Haxe Kha which gets full performance regardless of platform). It’s still in alpha though, so you will run into frequent bugs and features that are missing. Don’t expect either to magically vanish soon. Things are improving rapidly though, so you never know what will improve next.

## What language should I use for “maximum performance”?
Aromry uses Haxe language, which compiles to native source code for whatever language and API your platform prefers. That then compiles to a native binary that runs at full native speed. Haxe takes care of the translations to the different languages.
