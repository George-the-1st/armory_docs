# Common pitfall while using Armory Engine

###  I made changes to my game. Why donâ€™t they show up when I start the game?

Armory caches builds of the game. Sometimes you need to clean this cache, click `Clean` button next to `Play` button under `Scene Tab` in `Armory Player`, and you are good to go!
